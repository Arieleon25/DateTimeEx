# DateTimeEx

The DateTimeEx project is a console application that demonstrates the usage of DateTime in C#. It includes printing the current date and time to the console and calculating the future time based on user input.

# Project Description
The DateTimeEx project consists of a single file, Program.cs.

Program.cs

This file contains the Program class, which contains the Main method. In the Main method, the program prints the current date and time using the DateTime.Now property and the ToString method.

Next, the program asks the user to enter a number. The user input is then converted to an integer using the int.Parse method.

The program calculates the future time by adding the user-inputted number of hours to the current date and time using the AddHours method of the DateTime class. The future time is then printed to the console using the ToString method.

# Instructions
Start the console application.

The program will print the current date and time to the console.

The program will ask you to enter a number.

Enter a number and press Enter.

The program will calculate the future time by adding the entered number of hours to the current date and time.

The program will print the future time to the console.

The program will terminate.

You can rerun the program to test different scenarios and see the future time for different input values.

# Skills Demonstrated
